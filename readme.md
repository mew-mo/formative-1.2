# Formative 1.2 - Coding a Lofi UI
##### YOOBEE COLLEGES LEVEL 6 WEB AND UX 2021
Coding a lofi wireframe.

-

###### :sparkles: Where it Started
A group of four, dubbed the 'Delicious Designers', consisting of Rane Magno, Matt Brown, Bee Currie and myself, were given a task. The task at hand was to create lofi wireframes for a student services card through the UX process.

###### :sparkles: So what is this?
This project tackles turning the wireframe we created into a real, responsive website layout that could be akin to a real-life outcome.

###### :sparkles: What's the point of this creation?
In simple honesty, this is being made for class. But to be more precise, our project focused on creating an easy-to-use website that provides Yoobee students easy access to discounts and deals they may be interested in.
